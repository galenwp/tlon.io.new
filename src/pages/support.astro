        <h1 class="py-4">Scope of this Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="py-4">Tlon Corporation ('Tlon,' 'we,' 'our,' and/or 'us') values the privacy of individuals who use Tlon Hosting, Urbit software, our websites, and other Tlon offerings and related services (collectively, our 'Services'). This privacy policy (the 'Privacy Policy') explains how we collect, use, and share information from users of our Services ('Users'). By using our Services, you understand and agree to the collection, use, disclosure, and procedures this Privacy Policy describes. Beyond the Privacy Policy, your use of our Services is also subject to our Terms of Service.</p>
        <h3 class="py-4">Your privacy matters</h3>
        <p class="py-4">At Tlon, we care about your privacy and believe that ownership, privacy and control don’t need to be sacrificed in exchange for usability, accessibility and reliability. That’s why we limit our collection and use of your personally identifiable information (“PII”) to what’s necessary to provide our Services to you, unless you give us your consent.</p>

        <h2 class="py-4">Information we collect</h2>
        <p class="py-4">We may collect a variety of information from or about you or your devices from various sources, as described below. We collect information: 1) when you provide it to us or give us permission to collect it; and 2) automatically, when you interact with the Services.</p>

        <p class="py-4">Address Space Information. When you acquire Urbit address space from Tlon, you voluntarily provide us with certain information, such as your name and email. You may also provide us with your Ethereum wallet address and public key.</p>
        <p class="py-4">Communications. If you contact us directly, we may receive additional information about you. For example, when you chat with us in Urbit or contact support, we may receive your email address, the contents of a message or attachments that you may send to us, and other information you choose to provide.</p>

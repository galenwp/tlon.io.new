            <p class="py-4 text-lg">Once upon a time, the internet inspired an exciting picture of things to come. Young and uncharted, it stirred our imaginations. The things we'd discover. The people we’d meet. The things we'd do.</p>
            <p class="py-4 text-lg">Today, instead, we're burdened by notifications and reminders. We're wary of where our data's going and who's holding onto it. Instead of elevating our lives, the possibilities have exhausted us.</p>
            <p class="py-4 text-lg">The pillars of the internet—social networks, e-commerce, search engines—might feel like permanent fixtures. Maybe they are. But that can’t be it.</p>
            <p class="py-4 text-lg">Rather than a dead end, we see a fork in the road, at which we encounter another path forward. This path is bumpy at first, but soon the relief settles in. Calm is restored. A new world unfolds beyond the thick of yesterday's internet.</p>

            />
            
            <p class="py-4 text-lg">You receive a message. There's a purity to it that you can't quite place. You can almost pluck it right off your screen. It's as alive as a whisper spoken from one friend to another, as they part ways at a train station. It's as authentic as a love letter. As personal as an apology. As material as a family recipe passed down through generations.</p>
            <p class="py-4 text-lg">Because there's no one—besides yourself and the sender—storing the message on your behalf. There's no one acting as a middle man between the transaction. It belongs only to the two of you. It always will.</p>
            <p class="py-4 text-lg">A meetup invitation lives solely amongst a group, binding them closer. A journal entry stays entirely with you. A developer named Andrey's latest bookkeeping app ships directly to someone named Savannah, whose bookkeeping stays safely with her.</p>
            <p class="py-4 text-lg">The difference appears small on paper. But it's everything. The internet had gotten between our most important moments. Our most private and precious interactions. Now, it recedes beneath us, enabling a truly person-to-person network, where we build with our own tools, on our own platforms, for people we call our community.</p>
            <p class="py-4 text-lg">This is the internet we've dreamed of—both before we knew what was possible and after we knew what was at stake.</p>
            <p class="py-4 text-lg">It's possible on Urbit. And we have Landscape to prove it.</p>
            <p class="py-4 text-lg italic">Originally published in Tlon Local, our growing community on the Urbit network.</p>

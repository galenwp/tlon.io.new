Twenty questions with ~natnex-ronret

1. What's your community's origin story?

Given the fact I have a lot of fun making mixtapes and it comes easy to me, why not share it? First, maybe I should highlight that I worked in the music industry for years as an art director and music and its exploration has been part of my life from a young age. I spend my hours researching, buying and collecting material from producers all over the world.

Door's origin dates back to the lockdown. Suddenly the scenario was the same for most people. For me, spending a lot of time on the computer was pretty normal, but I found that friends and family were more overwhelmed and involved with their devices and social media than usual. The experience on many platforms was generally similar: 24/7 suggestions for this or that, because if you had no other choice, your life was going to be locked up... so core aspects of people such as curiosity and patience - which were already manipulated - started to dissolve even more.

It was then one night, looking out from my balcony at my neighbors on their computers that I thought: why not work on a project like Door now? — Still remember that it took only a few weeks after the launch of the site for the Door group to be born in Urbit. So good.

2. How many people first joined?

Not sure… 20, 30?

3. How long have y'all been communing?

2 years

4. Person in your community you can't wait to meet IRL?

That’s secret

5. Any rituals you feel comfortable sharing?

A shared meal/reading/listening or lying down in the living room is enough. These are good practices for the individual and collective psyche.

6. What do you like most about Landscape?

It's almost a tactile experience. This is the first thing that comes to my mind. Using Landscape is like walking into a very quiet room for me, and if I wanted the opposite or something different, that could also happen. Isn't that fascinating?

7. Tell us about your setup on Groups…

Well I'm in several groups but in general I'm quite a lurker so I'm here and there without saying much.

8. If you could add one feature, what would it be?

What I need is what I am already using. Beyond Landscape, since we all dream of using Urbit in very distinct ways — why not native hardware?

9. Most interesting conversation you've had in Groups or Talk?

I had several, I think they happened mostly with my Tlon peers.

10. Nickname or @p purity?

Whatever you want.

11. Favorite groups outside of your own?

Urmetica and Wind

12. Current mood?

Tranquila

13. If you had to give up one piece of technology what would it be?

My e-reader.

14. What technology would you preserve?

A pencil.

15. If you could be someone else for the day who would it be?       

A mountain climber or an mma fighter… hard to choose.

16. When was the last time you did something for the first time? 

Can’t remember.

17. Last meme you sent someone?

[hold]

18. Favorite YouTube video?

No favs, currently following Big Bear Bald Eagle Live Nest - Cam 1.

19. Complete silence or white noise?

Silence most of time.

20. Neopets or Club Penguin?

Mr. Arvo & Co.

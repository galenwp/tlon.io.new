It's been a busy month for the Landscape development team. Since our last team update, we've gotten into the groove of releasing on a regularly scheduled cadence.

Maybe you've noticed? We're pushing fixes to Groups and Talk on a weekly basis. From here on out, we'll stick to this timeline. You can always track our progress on Github or watch one of our (now monthly) live streams.

Hopefully you've also noticed the improvements to notifications in the last few weeks. They're easier to clear, and much easier to read. Soon, your Small Talk notifications will be a lot more reliable, too.

Before we jump into what's coming, let's briefly recapitulate what's already been released. As mentioned, we added a 'Mark Read' button to chat channels within Groups and Talk so notifications don't endlessly stack up.

We also restored and repaired several issues with S3 storage. You can go back to uploading and sending the meme of the moment to your friends. Enjoy.

Finally, we continue to tackle general glitchiness with Notebooks. For more details on specific bug requests, we direct you to the release notes for both updates.

And now, an overview of other updates and fixes in the pipeline. Highlight: Leap is coming back in v2.7.0 of Groups and Talk, invokable via Control+k (Command+k on a Mac).

Immediately:

- Reintroducing group, channel, and DM navigation with Leap
- Reintroducing the beloved talk-cli
- Adding the ability to bulk invite multiple ships to a group simultaneously
- Improving the ability to invite ships to a group during initial creation
- Redesigning how pinned channels are rendered within Groups to allow better scroll of non-pinned channels or communities
- Implementing a persistent support and wayfinding button across Talk and Groups
- Improving notifications in Groups and within an individual group
- Applying a warning before deleting a message or other datum
- Enhancing accuracy of unread badges
- Overhauling the chat scroll and addressing major mobile malfunctions
- Rectifying the order in which comments appear on Notebook posts

Soon:

- Migrating the My Channels group from Groups 1 as a new, secret group
- Fixing an issue that prevents profile edits from propagating to other ships

One month:

- Revamping and stabilizing the group admin view

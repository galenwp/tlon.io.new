        Tlon exists to build exceptionally well-crafted software
        for peopleâ€™s everyday lives.
        In order to build software of the highest quality, we had
        to start with excellent raw material. <br> <br>

        Our material is <a href="https://urbit.org" target="_blank">Urbit</a>.<br> <br>

        Tlon exists to animate the infrastructural material 
        Urbit represents and give people a means to
        inhabit it, play with it, make it theirs, and give it life.<br> <br>

        Tlon exists to build truly simple, beautiful, 
        durable, personal computers.

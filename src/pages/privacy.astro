            <p class="py-4 text-lg">Tlon Corporation ('Tlon,' 'we,' 'our,' and/or 'us') values the privacy of individuals who use Tlon Hosting, Urbit software, our websites, and other Tlon offerings and related services (collectively, our 'Services'). This privacy policy (the 'Privacy Policy') explains how we collect, use, and share information from users of our Services ('Users'). By using our Services, you understand and agree to the collection, use, disclosure, and procedures this Privacy Policy describes. Beyond the Privacy Policy, your use of our Services is also subject to our Terms of Service.</p>
            <h3 class="py-4 text-lg">Your privacy matters</h3>
            <p class="py-4 text-lg">At Tlon, we care about your privacy and believe that ownership, privacy and control don’t need to be sacrificed in exchange for usability, accessibility and reliability. That’s why we limit our collection and use of your personally identifiable information (“PII”) to what’s necessary to provide our Services to you, unless you give us your consent.</p>

            <h2 class="py-4 text-lg">Information we collect</h2>
